## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/5hupra/Retinal-Fundus-Classifier.git
cd retinal-fundus-classifier
```

### 2. Download the dataset

The dataset is hosted on Kaggle. You need a Kaggle account to download it.

**Balanced dataset (recommended — already preprocessed):**
```
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhamprakash11/processed-dataset2
```

**Original raw dataset:**
```
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhamprakash11/retinal-fundus-images
```

Or download via Kaggle CLI:
```bash
pip install kaggle
kaggle datasets download -d shubhamprakash11/processed-dataset2
unzip processed-dataset2.zip -d data/
```

### 3. Download the trained models

Models are not included in this repository due to file size (~760 MB total).
Download them from the Kaggle notebook output:
```
https://www.kaggle.com/code/shubhamprakash1751/retinal-fundus-kaggle/output
```

Download these 4 files and place them in `backend/models/`:
```

### 4. Run the backend
```bash
cd backend
py -3.11 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
source venv/bin/activate     # Mac/Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 5. Run the frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
